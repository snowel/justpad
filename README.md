# justpad

Justpad is a second-brain type application meant to feel as simple as a paper notebook. Justpad features tags, links, directory structures and general metadata.

## State of things & _WARNING_

Justpad is currently under initial development. While many features are (tentatively) functional, the database scheme is still in a formative stage and things will change.
